# Final Project Proposal

## Group Members:

Naoki Conning and Turbold Gerald

# Intentions:

We are running a distributed algorithm to solve a Linear Regression. The project will create a random sample (prob normally distributed) of data points around a pre-specified equation, and will then run a linear regression to reconstruct the equation.

# Intended usage:

A description as to how the project will be used (describe the user interface). (CHANGE THIS!!!!!)

# Technical Details:

We will be using:
- Allocating memory (data points)
- processes (forking)
- shared memory (communication across processes)
- sockets (networking across computers)

Until Turo responds to his messages, I am in charge of the project.

# Intended pacing:

Hope to finish the Regression method across the processes of a computer by Monday, will extend to networking by Friday.
